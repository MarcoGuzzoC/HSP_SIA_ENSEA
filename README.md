## CNN Implementation on GPU

Our goal is to implement the very famous LeNet-5 CNN on GPU using Cuda.

To do so we need to implement several functions. At least we need to understand how to deal with matrices : initializing, adding, multiplying...
Then it's important to understand a CNN structure and so code the mandatory functions just as 2D-convolution, pooling (max / average), activation function (tanh here for simplicity), the flattening function and a way to create dense layers.

## Progression and work done during this project
### Step 1: Learning CUDA

Because it's a CUDA project, it seems important to learn how we can compile a function on a NVIDIA GPU - which is the specificity of CUDA - and not only on CPU as all the code written until now.
