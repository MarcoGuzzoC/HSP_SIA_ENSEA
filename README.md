## CNN Implementation on GPU

Our goal is to implement the very famous LeNet-5 CNN on GPU using Cuda.

To do so we need to implement several functions. At least we need to understand how to deal with matrices : initializing, adding, multiplying...
To do so we implement the function twice. One to be run on CPU (classical C++ functions) and one to be run on GPU (with blocks and threads allocation).
